# Rho-onic Starter Apps
This repo contains starter apps to use Ionic Framework within your RhoMobile application. These starter apps are based on the starter apps that Ionic Framework provides without the Cordova.JS file.

This repository is to accompany a [blog post](https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/docs/DOC-3444) discussing the topic. Each sample was created using the version of Ionic and Templates that were available at the time. 

> DISCLAIMER: Use at your own risk, but read the blog for instructions on performing your own integration.
